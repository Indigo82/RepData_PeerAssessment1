### Libraries
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(fasttime)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
setwd("C:\\Users\\Sven\\Desktop\\Coursera\\RepResearch\\RepData_PeerAssessment1\\")
opts_chunk$set(dev="png", fig.path="figure/")
```





### Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo=TRUE}
activity <- fread("activity.csv", na.strings="NA", colClasses = c("steps" = "double"))   #read data
activity[, date := fastPOSIXct(date)]                                                    #convert to date
```







### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
activitygrouped <- activity[, .(steps = sum(steps, na.rm = T)), by="date"]             #aggregate by day
activitygrouped[, .(mean=mean(steps, na.rm = T), median=median(steps, na.rm = T))]     #Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
ggplot(data=activitygrouped, aes(steps)) + geom_histogram(bins=10)                     #Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
activity
```





### What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r echo=TRUE}
steps <- activity[, .(mean = mean(steps, na.rm = T)), by = "interval"]
ggplot(steps, aes(x=interval, y=mean)) +  geom_line()            #Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
steps[which.max(mean)]                                    #The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
```





### Imputing missing values
```{r echo=TRUE}
activity[is.na(steps), .N]                                                    # Total Number of rows with missing values
activity[, MeanSteps := mean(steps, na.rm = T), by=.(data.table::week(date))  # calculate mean of week
    ][is.na(steps), steps := MeanSteps, by=.(data.table::week(date))          # replace missing values with mean 
      ][, MeanSteps := NULL]
activity <- activity[, .(steps = sum(steps, na.rm = T)), by="date"]             #aggregate by day
activity[, .(mean=mean(steps, na.rm = T), median=median(steps, na.rm = T))]     #Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
ggplot(data=activity, aes(steps)) + geom_histogram(bins=10)                     #Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```

Imputing increase the mean and median value!



### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r echo=TRUE}

```
